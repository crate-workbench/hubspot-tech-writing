# Development

This section describes how to install the software within a development
sandbox on your workstation, and how to run the software tests.


## Install Sandbox
Acquire source code and install development sandbox. The authors recommend
to use a Python virtualenv.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/crate-workbench/hubspot-tech-writing
cd hubspot-tech-writing
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --editable='.[develop,docs,test]'
```


## Run Software Tests
Run linters and software tests:
```shell
poe check
```

Exclusively run individual tests.
```shell
pytest -k cli
```


## Run a Release

```shell
git tag v0.x.x
git push && git push --tags
```

Build sdist and wheel packages, and upload them to PyPI.
```shell
poe release
```

Navigate to the [release page on GitHub], and announce the corresponding release,
adding the changelog items from the [](../CHANGES.md) file instead of the items
automatically generated by GitHub.
